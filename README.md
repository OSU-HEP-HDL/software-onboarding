# software-onboarding
Onboarding project for new software team employees to practice basic git commands. 

I want you to clone this repo, make your own branch, add a professional photo and bio that we can use for the team, and commit your changes to the main branch. Assign me as the reviewer. If done correctly I'll merge the branches!

# Software Team

![Hi! My name is Dr. Jacob E. Crosby. I am currently the manager of the Software Team at the OSU High Energy Physics Hardware Development Lab. I graduate from OSU with my PhD in High Energy Physics. The title of my dissertation is"SEARCHES FOR NEW PHYSICS USING UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING FOR ANOMALY DETECTION AT THE ATLAS DETECTOR AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS FOR THE HL-LHC". I currently live in Michigan with my wife and a beautiful baby boy. Which means I work 100% remote!](assets/headshot1.jpg)
